</p>

## ‚ú® Features

*   **üé¨ Video Creation Mode:** Generate new videos from text prompts using Sora 2 or Sora 2 Pro.
*   **üé® Video Remix Mode:** Make targeted changes to existing videos with new prompts.
*   **‚öôÔ∏è Full API Parameter Control:** Access and adjust all relevant parameters supported by the Sora 2 API directly through the UI (model selection, resolution, duration, optional input reference for first frame).
*   **üîÑ Multi-Video Queuing:** Queue multiple videos for generation simultaneously - create as many videos as you want while others are processing.

*   **üìú Detailed History & Cost Tracking:**
    *   View a comprehensive history of all your video generations and remixes.
    *   See the parameters used for each request (model, resolution, duration, prompt).
    *   Get detailed cost breakdowns (`$USD`) for each video. (hint: click the `$` amount on the video)
    *   Real-time progress tracking for videos currently being generated.
    *   Click any prompt to copy the full text.
    *   View total historical API cost.
    *   Delete individual videos from history (removes from local storage and OpenAI servers).
    *   Failed requests are tracked separately with error messages and excluded from cost calculations.

</p>

*   **üé• Video Output Panel:** View generated videos with built-in player controls, progress slider, and playback controls.
*   **üöÄ Send to Remix:** Quickly send any completed video (including remixes) to the remix form for further modifications.
*   **üì• Video Download:** Download generated videos directly to your device.
*   **üíæ Storage:** Supports two modes via `NEXT_PUBLIC_FILE_STORAGE_MODE`:
    *   **Filesystem (default):** Videos saved to `./generated-videos` on the server (includes video, thumbnail, and spritesheet).
    *   **IndexedDB:** Videos saved directly in the browser's IndexedDB (ideal for serverless deployments like Vercel).
    *   Video history metadata is always saved in the browser's local storage.
    *   Active job IDs are persisted - resume polling automatically after page refresh.

## üöÄ Getting Started [Local Deployment]

Follow these steps to get the playground running locally.

### Prerequisites

*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (Version 20 or later required)
*   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/), [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/), or [bun](https://bun.sh/)

### 1. Set Up API Key üü¢

You need an OpenAI API key to use this application.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Your OpenAI Organization needs access to Sora 2 API** - This is currently in limited beta. Check [OpenAI's documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs) for availability.

**Quick start:** Rename `.env.local.example` to `.env.local` and update the values, or create a new `.env.local` file manually.

1.  If you don't have a `.env.local` file, create one (or rename `.env.local.example`).
2.  Add your OpenAI API key to the `.env.local` file:

    ```dotenv
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
    ```

    **Important:** Keep your API key secret. The `.env.local` file is included in `.gitignore` by default to prevent accidental commits.

#### Password Protection

Add password authentication to protect your local deployment:

```dotenv
APP_PASSWORD=your_password_here
```

When `APP_PASSWORD` is set, the application will prompt for authentication on page load. This prevents unauthorized access to your deployment.

</p>

#### File Storage Mode

Configure where generated videos are stored:

```dotenv
NEXT_PUBLIC_FILE_STORAGE_MODE=fs  # or indexeddb
```

**Defaults:**
- **Local deployments:** `fs` (filesystem) - Videos saved to `./generated-videos` directory (includes video, thumbnail, and spritesheet files)
- **Vercel deployments:** `indexeddb` (browser storage) - Videos stored in your browser's IndexedDB

**Available modes:**
- **`fs` (filesystem):** Videos saved to the server's `./generated-videos` directory. Only works for local deployments or hosting with persistent filesystem.
- **`indexeddb` (browser storage):** Videos downloaded from OpenAI and stored in the browser's IndexedDB. Ideal for serverless/ephemeral environments.

**Important:** If you explicitly set `NEXT_PUBLIC_FILE_STORAGE_MODE=fs` on Vercel, it will be automatically overridden to `indexeddb` to prevent errors (Vercel's filesystem is read-only/ephemeral).

For local development, you can use either mode. If not set, the application auto-detects the environment.

---

#### Custom API Endpoint

If you need to use an OpenAI-compatible API endpoint (e.g., a local model server or a different provider), you can specify its base URL using the `OPENAI_API_BASE_URL` environment variable in your `.env.local` file:

```dotenv
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
OPENAI_API_BASE_URL=your_compatible_api_endpoint_here
```

If `OPENAI_API_BASE_URL` is not set, the application will default to the standard OpenAI API endpoint.

### 2. Install Dependencies üü¢

Navigate to the project directory in your terminal and install the necessary packages:

```bash
npm install
# or
# yarn install
# or
# pnpm install
# or
# bun install
```

### 3. Run the Development Server üü¢

Start the Next.js development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
# yarn dev
# or
# pnpm dev
# or
# bun dev
```

### 4. Open the Playground üü¢

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your web browser. You should now be able to use the Sora 2 Playground!

## ‚ñ≤ Deploy to Vercel

Deploy your own instance of this playground to Vercel with one click:

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https://github.com/alasano/sora-2-playground&env=OPENAI_API_KEY,APP_PASSWORD&envDescription=OPENAI_API_KEY%20required.%20APP_PASSWORD%20required%20during%20setup%20(protects%20public%20deployment%2C%20removable%20in%20settings%20afterward).&project-name=sora-2-playground&repository-name=sora-2-playground)

### What Happens When You Deploy:

1. **Vercel clones this repository** to your GitHub account (creates a private repo by default)
2. **Deploys from the `master` branch** to a production URL
3. **You'll be prompted to enter** environment variables during setup
4. **Your deployment goes live** immediately after setup completes

### üîí Important Security Note:

**Your deployment URL will be publicly accessible** by anyone who has the link. This is how Vercel works - production deployments from your master branch are public by default.

Without protection, anyone who discovers your URL can use your OpenAI API key to generate videos at your expense. This is why `APP_PASSWORD` is required during the initial setup to add authentication to your deployment.

You can remove `APP_PASSWORD` later through Vercel Project Settings if desired, but this will leave your deployment unprotected.

### Environment Variables:

During deployment, you'll be prompted to provide:

- **`OPENAI_API_KEY`** *(required)* - Your OpenAI API key for accessing Sora 2 API
- **`APP_PASSWORD`** *(required during setup)* - Password protection for your deployment. Prevents unauthorized users from accessing your app and consuming your API credits. Can be removed later in Vercel Project Settings if you want to make the deployment public.
- **`NEXT_PUBLIC_FILE_STORAGE_MODE`** *(optional, auto-detected)* - Automatically set to `indexeddb` when running on Vercel. Videos are stored in your browser instead of the server. No need to configure this manually.

### üîê Advanced: Protected Preview Deployments

If you want your deployment protected by Vercel team authentication instead of being publicly accessible:

1. **Create a new branch** in your GitHub repo (e.g., `production`):
   - Via GitHub UI: Branches ‚Üí New branch
   - Or locally: `git checkout -b production && git push -u origin production`
2. **Go to Vercel:** Project Settings ‚Üí Git ‚Üí Production Branch
3. **Change** from `master` to `production`
4. **Result:**
   - Deployments from `master` branch ‚Üí Preview deployments (requires Vercel login to access)
   - Deployments from `production` branch ‚Üí Public production deployments

### Post-Deployment:

- Videos are automatically stored in your browser's IndexedDB (no server storage)
- You can add, modify, or remove environment variables anytime in Vercel Project Settings
- You can add a custom domain in Vercel Project Settings ‚Üí Domains
